That date comes and guess what you've still got a membership! Confused so look it up, apparently You can't cancel your membership if you applied through a 3rd party.

Also when using ad tier there are even more ad breaks and longer ads per hour now. That's for making my decision I will be instructing my wife to cancel subscription after this month. It's the month of Halloween and hardly any horror or gore titles. I am sick of the romance and woke titles that litter this app. Peace may sub again in few months,3

39fa03c3-8c70-40d1-8dc4-7b74fa46785a,fun to watch,5
944a1ba4-37d0-42ff-aa39-466192972008,I enjoy watching the WWE. Unfortunately now I have to watch it on Netflix and I only get half of an episode because there's so many issues with the streaming. They record the WWE and it sucks until they fix it that's after they get it published. So I have to wait 3-4 days before they fix the issues so I can finish watching it while fixing the issues they add all the ads. So rather than watching half an episode in 1 hour it takes 3 hours just to watch the whole episode because of all the ads.,1

f2d93c2d-931f-43e2-a303-04bab46bacd9,the new interface is terrible you can't just look up a certain genres of shows and films. if you happen to have a list of a type you want it's extremely limited you have to search by name of movie or show or hope their algorithm gives you what you want. Please go back to being able to see a large selection when you go into different genres or let people see the list from A-Z.

However, what’s been frustrating lately is that I can’t watch anything on my phone because of the new household policy. I have five different Wi-Fi networks, and if I’m not connected to the one originally set, Netflix claims I’m outside my own household. It didn’t bother me much at first, but over time it’s become incredibly annoying.",1

The recommendation system often repeats movies I’ve already watched, and the options feel limited. I’ve also noticed that if you watch a foreign-language film or series, the platform gets stuck on it—suddenly 80% of the recommendations are in that language. This causes English-language content and films from other countries to lose visibility. need more translation options.",3

dad18988-a206-4317-8f54-9cf952e4e0cb,I don't see why Netflix had to change the interface. The newest version feels a step back into the stone age. You cannot choose a specific genre. You have to keep scrolling like an idiot to get to one you want. Then you have to keep pressing the side button to scroll through that genre. Why?? I'm going to unsubscribe soon if they don't fix this mess. I'm already using free websites because they are easier to navigate in any event.

cc89d06f-18ef-4e8d-b0f0-da543074db4c,Netflix is awsome on anything else except android devices. I am currently using my xperia play. And I would not trade it in for the world. Anyway I digress. Not to long ago netflix updated and I am no longer able to use it on a android 2.3.3 o.s. And I only gave this app a 1 star rating because there is no selection for a zero for this crumy app.	This app deserves a zero mainly have netflix for when I am bored on the go. Now that is no more. Either fix it or I will just have to switch to funimation. Thank you for xbox app and website. But this app is pure shinanigans.,4

1760c31e-1452-4133-9217-c9b66c86e0b9,"""I really enjoy using Netflix and appreciate the wide variety of shows and movies available. However, I have noticed that many seasons are not available in Hindi dubbed. It would be very helpful if more shows and seasons were provided with Hindi dubbing, as this would make the viewing experience much easier and more enjoyable for many users like me.""",3

fff9dd1f-a196-4cc7-a3f9-a0a510d860f3,I have the in ad subscription. When watching a series the app will start to skip ads which also makes it come back to the series 1o seconds in after a planned commercial break. No amount of scrubbing backwards will make it stop skipping those 10 seconds. I either have to back out to the menu or completely close the app then reopen it. This doesn't always work.,3

The amount of content is huge, from big movies to a ton of Netflix Originals like Stranger Things and The Crown.
