f34b6710-608a-418c-bf0d-399e1123156c,Since i downloaded this app ive been getting calls from random numbers🙃. I figured how to stop it you got to change whatever is on the privacy page. Thats not cool. This is not a safe app to use. The feature to which everyone can msg or call you shouldnt be automatically activated by viber. On set it should always be off. If the user decides to show everyone that they can be contacted by every viber user then users can go back to settings to enable it by themselves not viber!,1

Also the paid aspects of Dating offer little value. Dating is full of fake profile scammers that Viber doesn't actually do anything about. Add to this the empty form provided to be tediously filled out for any contact of customer service. No they don't actually want to hear from you and won't be reading anything ever that isn't a public review.,1

8d8a9c3c-d4b6-45e8-aadc-80f4eb4f51d7,This app keeps opening Shopee whenever I make calls. Very annoying and spammy. Also many scammers use this app. Pictures sent via Viber are compressed to hell and back and there's no option to send it at a higher quality. Calling and Ringing status is also confusing for older users.. it needs to be communicated clearer. Ads are inserted in between the message list making the app more cluttered than it needs to be. Scrolling between messages sent in the same week is more cumbersome.,2

Кожен день сиплеться купа рекламного та шахрайського мотлоху, і замість того, щоб реально боротися з цим, вони блокують самих користувачів, яким цей спам приходить. Абсурд повний.

f5fdb1c3-7a1b-4ac9-ba85-657f3a7a7d8d,"Viber is a popular messaging and calling app, but in my experience, it requires a very strong internet connection to work properly. Even with decent mobile data, the call quality is often poor. The voice does not sound clear, and sometimes it is hard to understand the other person. Video calls also freeze or lag if the network is not stable. Compared to other apps,",1

8e476f02-12ff-4dcc-8b77-2d90c30e1ca7,I changed phone from an iPhone 15 to a Samsung S25 Plus. Now I can't access my Viber account. I emailed Viber support and they haven't responded yet. It's been three days. It always tells me that a phone call will be made and I have to enter the last 4 digits of the calling number. The problem is I never received the call. I don't know if my phone number is blocked or flagged for some reason. It's frustrating not to be able to speak with somebody to fix the issue.,2

a005b688-74c3-435d-8ab4-199d9db81a23,This app is good BUT I'm still receiving a random Shopee ad that will open on the app. This happened a lot of times already & I've reported it. It's still happening. Also I know this app used to have an option to not allow Unknown numbers to contact me & I always have it turned on. It's been months since y'all removed it & because of that SCAMMERS ARE MESSAGING ME! Y'all were great until y'all removed that option. Scammers are now using your app to scam people! I ALWAYS HAVE VIBER IN TURNED OFF.,3

ed7de888-0717-4f4f-b2fb-0758cbac3b03,Chat history backup doesn't work and it's impossible to backup from PC to Android. EDIT: Viber won't warn you before uninstalling that the chat history will be lost. I had tried backing up before and it didn't work. The aftermath is that I've lost very crucial messages that are only available in the desktop version. It should be possible to sync from PC to Android.,1

0138337e-37b5-4e0b-99c8-b8322cb95773,I tried to view a recent message but it was blurred like for photos. I even restarted my phone but it is still blurred.

Multiple tries to actually make a call, it almost always hungs up saying call failed and giving two options: try again and open viber. If while calling, you tap on the speakers after 1-2 beeps the speakers turn off and the calling tune play through the ear speaker again. Overall the viber out part needs to be taken care off. Viber is a good app and unfortunately this part is not on par with the rest of the application. Please take care of it",3

9bf481fb-b871-4445-b83b-3c06387ac7c0,Viber sometimes does not send text messages(e.g. I send a text message from the notification bar and the text never goes to the other person) and also notifications do not appear some times(e.g. when I get a call or videocall or a photo message I do not receive a notification always). Other times does not let you answer viber calls like you answer and nothing happens when Instagram at the same time does let you(so it's not a connection problem). Fix it please.,2

2f77615b-154b-4271-90f6-7d66ee3d9782,one of the Viber's best features is the disappearing message service. it made me feel safe. As all pictures and texts cannot be saved by screenshot too. Other apps offer disappearing messages BUT still the receivers could screenshot the conversation. This Viber's best feature made me feel that I still can have privacy online. Thanks so much for the development team.,5

There is no web version like every other messaging app. There is so much advertising in the app. The sounds are so annoying even silencing the notification is not enough?!

dcc1eb22-2a9f-4458-999b-758e23e7572d,"I've never had this much problems with other apps. It is designed to be NOT USER FRIENDLY. By design, it is made more difficult for the user. You are unable to freely choose where to backup your chats and if you want to delete old massive backups, you are unable to do so. Everything is hidden for ""security reasons"". I cannot choose to be less secure. You often just cannot backup chats on old devices. There isn't an option to transfer your chats from iPhone to Android or vice versa. Madness.",1

It's very annoying. I understand maybe it's your profit strategy to boast any aspect of ads or what but as viber I am just sharing my honest experience. Hopefully this will be fixed in the future.,2

Sucks! No app should use voice over cellular without asking. Really poor design. Waste of money. Should call it Viper rather than Viber. If you need to make any calls check first if you can use WiFi to make calls. Save yourself time and money. How these poor quality apps get so big is beyond me. Cancelled my subscription. Money back? 1 day",1

It is a very good idea, but unfortunately it is full of fake accounts. One example is it shows a woman who apparently lives from me 4 km and is looking for a relationship. I know everyone in the city and this woman is not anywhere there. No one knows of her and for sure i know she is a fake. One person i met wanted me to buy jewlery from her. It has been reported to Viber and they do nothing",1
