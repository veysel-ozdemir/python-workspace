Deleting Unnecessary Files: * Identify large files: * Start by identifying the largest files and folders in your Dropbox. These are the ones that will free up the most space. * Delete files: * Delete any files or folders that you no longer need. You can do this through the Dropbox website or the Dropbox folder on your computer. * Empty the deleted files,5

eb4cef09-e8ac-4d7f-8226-55beb770d07b,I really like Dropbox; I've been using it since college. But I've uninstalled it for now. 2 GB of space in a free plan is very little. And 999 rupees per month for a paid plan is too high. I'll install it again and pay when you've a better plan that asks for a fair price for storage between 2 GB to 2000 GB. I actually feel sad because Dropbox is not at all competitive by any stretch of imagination. Bye.,1

Once you were great. In the last few years your simple sleek UX turned into something horrendous. Especially when I open it in Ipad mini version it gets worse. Whats the purpose of the constantly open right panel window? Why dont you just allow us any other program as in Android version? In the PC version there are multiple multiple issues.,1

Noticed it says you won't be billed anymore after the billing cycle which leads to believe the free trial isn't free at all. I would definitely hope I don't get billed for an app that doesn't work when I canceled it in less than 10 hours later but we will see. Absolutely no way to even communicate with the makers of the app except through this review. Give the least to get the most. Pretty typical now days.,1

OP: App was always good except with the latest updates it's taking too many steps to upload if you have multiple accounts (personal with work). You need to switch accounts every time you want to upload. In the past to could just choose a file to upload and then decide which account and folder to put it in. No more.,5

Example, I'm on the 45min mark attempting to download a folder to my phone. I still have yet to accomplish that task, and I build websites for a living.",1

To create links for people to share with is always a challenge. Now I'm being harassed bec before 5 GB was free. Now 2 GB are free so I'm being harassed to upgrade and pay. Short memory dropbox. So I just want to take my pics and leave and close account. It doesn't allow me to download back my own pictures. It has always been difficult to do things around this app.,2

I opened the app and made sure it said cancel. Opened Google play store subscriptions Saud cancel. Today got an email from Dropbox said your subscription has been canceled due to us not being able to charge your preferred payment. Glad Inhad an outdated credit card or they would have charged me even though my account said cancel subscription.,1

For example I can no longer open files unless I rename them to .txt And there were no annoying popups when I was offline. I wish i could get the simple old Dropbox apps back which I loved using so much.",2

14b07ab1-904e-4322-a2f9-af39c32bb519,This is the worst app of its kind. I can't download my own videos. Uploading is so slow and it has set my business back. Do not waste your time with this app and do not pay money for it under any circumstances. I deleted videos I wanted to use for my YouTube channel to save space on my device. Now I've lost those forever as you simply can't get it back. I even see other people saying they have been charged money even though they cancelled their subscription or did not subscribe. Disgusting!,1

I was told that get your cases ring we will answer right away and send a bus. Lucky for us it wasn't raining. Going out system was very impressed so was expecting the same on arrival.
