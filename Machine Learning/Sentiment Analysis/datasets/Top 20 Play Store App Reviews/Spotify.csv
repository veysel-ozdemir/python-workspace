7584c441-5594-4645-a743-a23c19c98366,"You asked for a rating so I'm giving you one. The app is pretty bad. The desktop application is pretty good now, but the app is so bad. If you have a large library (>10,000 songs) and try to just press play and shuffle your library, it regularly takes around 5 minutes until the first song starts playing. Then when I try to skip a song, it doesn't play the next song but just sits there showing blank album art for a minute (still playing the last song) then gives up and just shows the song that was already playing. I'll try again and wait for like 60 seconds before it decides to move to the next song. It's not hard to make an app shuffle a lot of songs. Please make this basic functionality work. Spotify is also horrible at playing podcasts, regularly glitching out past a certain length, and forgetting my play position. I gave up and use a separate app for podcasts (which is way better), but spotify now CONSTANTLY tries to force podcasts in my face and ""recommend"" stupid podcasts, which in reality is just shoving ads in my face, for things I don't want, despite me paying for premium, and hundreds of people giving you guys feedback that we want all podcasts hidden or removed automatically (not by manually going into a ""music"" tab). You're even trying to turn yourself into tiktok/youtube and now forcing AUTOPLAYING VIDEO podcasts on my home page when I open the app. I DON'T WANT THIS VIDEO GARBAGE IN MY MUSIC APP I PAY FOR. GET RID OF IT. You don't even give us a setting to hide podcasts, to hide videos, or even to disable autoplay of videos (and the ""workaround"" of enabling the ""low bandwidth"" mode in settings IS NOT A SOLUTION TO THIS). And when I complain to your ""customer support"", it's just an AI chatbot telling me I can disable this and making up a setting that doesn't exist, because that's what LLMs do. They're not actual support. They just make up nonsense then say sorry goodbye. Please listen to your customers (and your paying customers) and stop making stupid decisions and forcing stupid stuff on us. I still like you as a service in general and despise apple, I just want you to do better and want to actually enjoy music on my phone effortlessly without all these stupid issues.",2

26a615c5-e92e-49ec-9410-2ce14e977908,greedy and money grubbing. poor quality. honestly i cant figure out how they create such a bad app. the 'Ai' dj and otherwise literally just replays the last 10 songs you listened to on repeat. all the 'for you playlists' are the same exact 5 top 40 song every day. are your developers a decoration? or a team filled with project managers and one poor dev. with the amount of money made its embarrassing how lacklustre all the features on spotify are. apple even plays music in better quality,1

Though, there are a lot of ads, and you can't pick and choose a song without it being on shuffle mode, it's fairly decent. It will eventually play your song, just maybe not at that moment, and will play a different one that is similar to the song you picked. You can make as many playlists as you want though! {I recommend computer/laptop use because you can pick your songs on demand even if it's free.}",4

7a4f7e1c-bb1e-43b2-b3d0-cfcf7fcc1c29,Is there going to be any effort to fix the issue where many users can't search for the playlists to add songs to? I've already come to terms with the fact that Spotify won't fix me not being able to pick up from where I left off from previous listening sessions. Example: Going to my country playlist when I was last listening to my hip hop playlist a couple hours ago. Long time premium user btw.,3

I play a song while I sleep and then I listen to "" get Spotify premium for ad free music"" what's the purpose?",1
b641452c-4a71-41a3-97f3-c1d542a5b59a,The audacity to charge an additional $12/month to listen to more than 15 hours of audiobooks is absurd! Already paying for premium isn't enough so you need to suck out another $12!? Disgusting and greedy!,1

5b43a4d3-3720-4e93-bb1e-2291ac437147,This app has become horrible after the latest update. After the new update it will not let you play the song which you want to listen instead it will play similar songs to it. Don't know what's the use of a music app which doesn't allow you to listen to a particular song which you want to listen. Forcefully pushing people to purchase the subscription. I have uninstalled finally and am now using Amazon music happily which atleast allows me to play my favorite song. Shame on you Spotify team!,1

Disliked some ads around 10 - 20 times still the same ads were coming. Not at all satisfied. It is solely good for premium users and they don't bloody care for the free users. Not at all recommend from my side. Last but not the least are the pathetic services. I won't even get a thought of downloading this app again.,1

e9c8d286-2975-4bf4-b41c-338b263a5e56,The purpose of this review is to present my findings and provide suggestions for the musoicc app spotify. Spotify is one of thhe most used music streaming app which has podcasts and music of many artists over the world.Even though its widely used it has some problems such as there being too many ads which feels like there are ads afer every single song.This is very frustrating many timees as it destroys the focus of many indivisuals.In conclusion it is a good app but they should remove some ads,4
14a7e0e7-6d79-4dc9-bc07-f4d7bcd3aa84,I just dont like this app because after 3 or 4 songs just the ads come of 1 or 2 min and and eyery time it ask for premium if you want to install this app first buy premium and it also says the quality of music also become better but it is fake😭😭🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡,1

If you're not letting me play my favourite songs then atleast play a song from the same playlist or the same artist....why do you switch to a completely different artist and it's not even like you come back after a different song or two you just change everything and play whatever you want.

f9e2d472-a6fe-4541-90ae-54cd85e775c8,"💢 Spotify Review – Not Worth It Without Premium Spotify used to be great, but now the ads are just too much. Every few songs, an ad pops up — sometimes even two or three in a row. It completely ruins the mood when you’re trying to relax or focus. The same ads repeat over and over, which makes it even more annoying. It feels like Spotify is forcing users to buy the Premium plan instead of improving the free experience. Overall, the ad interruptions make it frustrating to use.",1

b5b0a637-9afa-4eb3-8df0-97d1f36061a4,Spotify has been user-friendly. It has many features on its free version that I've enjoyed. Setting up my library of favorite artists and podcasts was a breeze. Adding songs to my favorites has been easy as well. I've used Spitify while out of the country and I haven't run into any problems. There are some ads with the free version but they are short and don't run too often.,5

I recently stopped using their services with the free from ads and used the free version. now that I have stopped, they purposely cut off my music when im off the app and has me stay on app to listen to music(randomly). The app is literally useless... don't recommend using their subscription, unless you want to he stuck paying because once you stop pay, they glitch your app!",1

2fe48a6d-f2b7-4094-89af-d0e396ed056e,The reason I'm giving Spotify a 1 star review is because the update that made looping a song part of the premium subscription was a terrible idea. I've used Spotify to help me focus on school work now I can't since I can no longer loop it as well as turn off shuffling. It's really annoying and frustrating. Please change it so I can fully loop a song.,1

My Playlist is constantly resetting. 10 songs into a playlist, move into my car, playlist starts over for some reason. Same if I switch home speakers, switch to Bluetooth etc. This needs to be fixed. Edit: 10/25 still not fixed. Now Spotify is glitchy (ier) and slow after the latest update. Constantly lagging or freezing. Plays explicit songs while turned off. Yuck.",1

a29b1786-25eb-4d5b-aae7-bfe63a7eec34,"Spotify has been my favorite streaming app for atleast the last 10, but I'm finally calling it quits. The AI suggestions have gotten so bad. Spotify is unusable without premium, but even with premium now, it just sucks. The daylists were amazing when they came out, I loved finding new music, but now they're a mix of things I'd never listen to with random, inapplicable titles. Shuffling your liked songs plays you the same songs, in the same order, no matter how often you skip them. I'm over it",1
9d45a612-a4cd-436f-ad95-f2a284f58c0b,It is the dominating app in music but there is very limited time limit for playing songs. If I want the music to stop after a certain time I can only do that upto an hour which is very short. It would be better if they added a custom button to it that let us set a timer of our choice in hours and minutes.,4

If you want to hear the preview of a song before adding it to a playlist you have to do serious gymnastics to add that song to the small section where you can do that. There are A LOT of things to fix with this app.,3

a7aefc85-3f47-44a3-a7fd-e82bfcb5bbeb,I love spotify and have been a premium user for a decade already. the new UI update is awful and adding a song to a playlist on mobile should not be so convuluted and annoying. when you finally add it to your playlist which is in a folder in a folder it takes ages just to go out of all the pages you needed to go through and go back to the song page.,3

b9229efe-6bbe-4b1d-a159-e93fc50eda77,I'm a YouTube music girly. I use another app to listen to my audio books. One thing I find missing on this app is a bookmark feature. If I use the sleep timer I like to save where I am in case I fall asleep too early. I'm still getting used to finding the books I need. Another caveat is the audiobook time limit. you get 15 hours a month listening time. Instead of a certain amount of books. If its a long book you may not have enough time allotted listen to the entire book within the month.,4

I just want the Spotify team to atleast put efforts for those who Don't have membership. Turn it in the same way it used to be. And nowdays they also shut down the lyrics section.,3

c4d9371f-8cde-436f-b25c-58aed5e637bb,"I’ve been using Spotify for years, but lately it’s become almost unbearable for non-premium users. The ads have gone from short 30-second ones to painfully long 90-second 1.5 mins interruptions, and even after that, they still claim “30 minutes of uninterrupted music” — which is totally false. The ""uninterrupted"" part barely lasts upto 10 mins before another ad pops up.Spotify used to be the best for discovering and enjoying music, but now everything changed. I'm switching to JIO SAAVAN or other",1

I don't use Spotify enough to want to buy premium but when I do it's not even worth it because I keep getting ads after like 2 songs even after the whole ""30 minutes of uninterrupted listening"" bs. It's especially worse when I keep getting the same four ads that are pointless and not even something worth listening to. This app used to be so good before it became money hungry",2

cad41a33-7fb6-4308-87ce-4e79086d7260,"The search feature is not working when I want to add songs to a playlist and forcing me to scroll through 50 or more of my playlist. It just makes trying to add songs to a playlist way more tedious and annoying, especially when I'm following 600+ artists as I always keep up to date every Friday on new music. Having to spend multiple minutes to add songs compared to last week taking me a few seconds per song. Also, it doesn't help that the search feature in general loads very slowly recently",3

0ae54255-4d2b-4f8b-babf-da7a74850c1c,"30 mins of uninterrupted music actually means 2 songs and the same 3 adverts on repeat. Podcasts take a ridiculous time for the same episode to appear here compared to other platforms. When putting a thumbs down on a particularly annoying advert, it appears to do nothing but guarantee you'll hear it even more. The ""free"" version is trash and doesn't make you want to pay for their bad service. Also Spotifys own advert is a lazily made piece of AI garbage. Shocking lack of quality.",1
