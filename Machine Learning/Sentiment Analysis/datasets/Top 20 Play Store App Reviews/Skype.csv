Then takes another 10 - 15 seconds to open a chat. Then takes another 10 - 15 seconds to open the keyboard. On top of visual glitches where the messages are cut off briefly after closing the keyboard. And certain words don't appear to fit properly causing the last letter to get moved to a second line.

08651970-f269-4440-a07f-c2f6daa083da,Trash app. To top up balance you need to store a card. To store card it annoyingly asks even about home address. Then it will reject the payment anyway and says check your country in Google play. Probably because the card country is different? Why does it matter I just want to top up and make a single stupid call to UPS America why is it so difficult with Skype? This app just wants to collect your data it's waste of time,1

There's absolutely no app I know of that's slower to react and perform in general, including basic functions such as dialing and initiating calls. Reminds me of the early days of the internet. Secondly, personal status involuntarily reverts to showing ""Active"" repeatedly, although I set it to ""Invisible.""

The worst is using emoticons, it's a nightmare of lagging and waiting for things to load. I wish the issues stopped there, but they don't. I can only assume the developers don't actually use the Skype app on a daily basis. It's really awful guys.",1

808b7dea-67c6-4a2a-9314-c5ebcab53954,Multiple problems As a user of an international Skype number and other subscriptions: 1. Sometimes the calling party can't hear a word I say. Other apps - no problem with mic or anything 2. Going into the keypad to dial a number is an absolute PAIN. Each number typed triggers what looks like a synchronous call to update the suggested contact list. Having a contact list with some hundreds makes this process TERRIBLY PAINFUL. 3. Skype switches between loud speaker and the earpiece speaker randomly,1

1fa10b30-5b5b-4743-afd5-3948ab11d1f6,Skype is broken. First off it wrongly identified me a human as a bot. Second it constantly logs off changing my visual settings. Third it pops up a large box obscuring my text that I have to navigate away from what I am reading and scroll up and down in increasing increments that I barely have enough room to click text to do so. Its call quality constantly makes me ask what the caller on the other side said. Its latency during calls causes either party to talk the other callers conversation,1
